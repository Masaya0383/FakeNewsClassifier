# FakeNewsClassifier

1. **Background:** The rise of digital news sources and social media has led to an explosion in the amount of news content available to the public. However, this has also led to an increase in the spread of misinformation or "fake news". Being able to automatically detect fake news can be a significant asset in maintaining the integrity and reliability of information circulated in public spaces. 

2. **Challenge:** The challenge is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately differentiate between fake and real news. This involves a variety of tasks: from loading and inspecting the data, to extracting features from the news text that can be used to train the model, and then evaluating the model's performance. Furthermore, due to the inherent complexity and variety of language used in news articles, creating an effective model for this task can be particularly difficult.

3. **Solution:** The solution implemented in the provided code begins with loading the news data into a pandas DataFrame. From there, numerous features are extracted from the text of the news articles, such as the tokens, sentences, text length, average sentence length, lexical diversity, non-stopword density, punctuation density, and the density of different POS tags. These features provide a detailed representation of each article that the model can learn from.

   The data is then split into two categories: 'fake' and 'real' news, and the most common bigrams in each category are extracted for further insights. After this, the text data is transformed into numerical data through the use of TF-IDF, and this numerical representation is combined with the other features for each article. 

   The data is then split into a training set and a test set, with the training data undergoing undersampling to address class imbalance. A Naive Bayes classifier is then trained on this undersampled data, with separate instances of the classifier being trained on count vectorized and TF-IDF vectorized representations of the data. The performance of each instance of the classifier is evaluated using the test set, with the results being printed out as classification reports.
   
   
## Future directions:

1. **Experiment with Different Models:** Naive Bayes is a good starting point, but other models might perform better on your data. Consider trying out models like Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting. Deep learning methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) or transformers like BERT could also yield good results, especially on large datasets.

2. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Each model comes with its own set of hyperparameters. These can greatly affect model performance, so it's worth experimenting with different values to see if you can improve your results. You might consider using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV from sklearn for this.

3. **Improve Feature Engineering:** There's always room for improvement when it comes to feature engineering. You might consider using other NLP techniques, such as Named Entity Recognition (NER), sentiment analysis, or more advanced lexical attributes.
